         <p>Education is not merely acquiring of facts but also of values which help us to improve different facts of mankind. To impact education is a unique kind of human service, one can do the society. The family is the basic and more important source for value based education, after family the second biggest influence in a child life is his school. Often our memories of childhood revolved around a great teacher who inspired us most.

          Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>Education is the most powerful weapon which we can use to change the world. Every child has a Potential to learn, in order to gain the knowledge and every educational institution provides a platform for learning and discipline .the moment a child enters the classroom; he brings to learn the rudiments of knowledge and discipline. We as educators have a noble task of motivating our students towards the path of success, which needs proper guidance at an early age; this will lead them to their desired destination and self-discovery.
We came forward with the “RKG International School” to provide value based quality education to our students to make them face any future challenges.
May God bless our Principal, Staff, Parents and Children with good health of mind and body .We anticipate the blessings and support of parents in their herculean task of grooming good citizens and human beings of tomorrow.
